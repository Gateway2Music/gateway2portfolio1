        <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Charles Cournoyer also known as Gateway2Music. I am a youtube content creator as well as a front-end developer. I have experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and am currently working on projects for a few friends including a website for a High School band, a hair stylist, and a twitch content creator. I am proficient in these languages but would also like to be able to learn from future projects as well as team members. I always say that if I'm the smartest person in the room, I'm definitely in the wrong room and would seriously enjoy an enviornment where I'm always learning. </p>
